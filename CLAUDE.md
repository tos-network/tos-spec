# tos-spec Project Rules

## Generated Files — Do Not Edit Manually

The following paths are **generated outputs** and must never be edited by hand:

- `vectors/` — generated by `tools/fixtures_to_vectors.py`
- `fixtures/**/*.json` — generated by `pytest --output fixtures`

To change their content, modify the **source of truth** under `tests/` and `src/tos_spec/`, then regenerate:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ --output fixtures -q
.venv/bin/python tools/fixtures_to_vectors.py
```

The only exception is `vectors/accounts.json`, which is also regenerated by pytest (via `tests/test_accounts.py`).
